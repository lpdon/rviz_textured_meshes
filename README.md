# RVIZ Textured Meshes
Plugin: Displays textured meshes (realtime or static sensor_msgs/Image topics) in 3D space

![Demo](https://github.com/lpdon/rviz_textured_meshes/blob/master/gifs/cap.gif)

## Usage

This is based on https://github.com/lucasw/rviz_textured_quads

It was developed because (apparently) there is no open source RViz plugin which loads a mesh into the scene with dynamic textures.
